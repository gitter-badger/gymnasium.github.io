title: Back to School with Office Hours!

It's September! And, if you're keeping score at home, you'd be right to point out that we're running behind schedule. 

The idea of holding _office hours_ [^1] has come up in conversation a few times in the past, but somehow we'd always ended up tangled in the logistics. However, when [Mike Bifulco](https://twitter.com/mbifulco) (our Director of Technology) suggested broadcasting a live stream of his development work, things started to come together.

## Watching Other People Write Code is Actually a _Thing_

It's not surprising that people want to watch other people write code... certainly not if you consider the popularity of [Stampy Cat](https://www.youtube.com/user/stampylonghead) et al. But watching someone play a video game is a bit different, right? If you're skeptical, you might want to read [The Strange Appeal of Watching Coders Code](https://medium.com/backchannel/the-strange-appeal-of-watching-coders-code-5c677b2c34ec/). While the potential for learning is touched on only briefly in that article, we think that there is an interesting educational opportunity that's worth exploring.

To wit, we are kicking off our "Gymnasium Office Hours" with a weekly live broadcast of Mike creating/fixing/breaking our new site (how's that for _meta_?). In addition to watching the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Django, and Python hackery, you also get to hear Mike's explanation of what he's doing. There's also live chat so you can ask him questions -- or maybe help him out when he's stuck!

## tl;dr: Office Hours. Live Coding. Be there.

__When:__ Tuesdays from 1:30 - 3:30 pm (Eastern)

__Where:__ [https://www.livecoding.tv/mbifulco/](https://www.livecoding.tv/mbifulco/)

By the way, this isn't our first foray into showing you behind the scenes at Gymnasium. In case you missed it, here's a look at how we create our course content. Sort of.

[^1]: For those of you who aren't familiar with the term, office hours refers to those blocks of time where university professors make themselves available to meet with students outside of class time. In my experience, office hours were generally uneventful... with the exception of those immediately preceding a deadline, or immediately following the return of graded papers or exams. The ebb and flow of students lining up outside the faculty offices offered a very predictable reflection of the school calendar in the same way that lunar phases phases reflect our civil calendars.
