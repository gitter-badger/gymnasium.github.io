This blog is possible thanks to the work of a number of people who are as generous as they are clever:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is the magic that generates the pages
- The theme is a lightly modified version of [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) -- which is built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole)
- We are hosting this blog on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
- We might never have known about Jekyll if not for Barry Clark's excellent [article on Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)
