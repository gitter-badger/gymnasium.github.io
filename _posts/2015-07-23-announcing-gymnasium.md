title: Announcing Gymnasium 2.0!
author: andrew

Yes so this is the big news. It's actually huge news. 

And, now it's official: __We are launching a new Gymnasium in ~~August~~!!!__

There are a few things that you need to know:

1. We will continue to provide the same great quality courses __for free__ - that's not changing.

2. We're still working out the details, but our goal is to make this move as painless (for you) as possible. You'll definitely need to come up with a new password, and we'll try to give you enough notice that you'll have time to think of a good one.

3. We will have to take things offline for a day or so while we move our data, and we'll let you know when that's going to happen as soon as we've got some firm dates.

4. Our upcoming courses, _Writing for Web & Mobile_ and _Introducing Sketch for UX and UI_ will both go live when the new Gymnasium launches.

Stay tuned for more updates...
