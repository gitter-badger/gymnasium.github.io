The final countdown to launching our new Gymnasium has commenced! It's happening this weekend, and this is how we expect things to unfold...

## 1. Gymnasium Goes off-line late Saturday afternoon (EST)

__Reality:__ Off-line? What? When did _this_ happen? But I have to finish my JavaScript class tonight or I'll get fired! It's been like two days... are they moving the data by hand?  [^1]   

## 2. You receive a very clever email and click to activate your account

__Reality:__ What's Gymnasium? They've moved _what_ exactly? Finally! I was wondering if I'd _ever_ be able to finish my UX class! [^2]   

## 3. You verify your details and pick a new password

__Reality:__ Ugh, another password? Can't they let me log in with my LinkedIn account? I mean who can't _do_ that these days? [^3]   

## 4. You're magically re-enrolled in all of your classes

__Reality:__ Oh cool, there's that Node class that I signed up for and couldn't make it past the second chapter. Why can't I just _un_ enroll from that class? [^4]   

## 5. Courses pick up (more or less) where you last left off

__Reality:__ Wait, I have to start this two minute video from the _beginning_? I'm pretty sure I've seen this lesson before. We went through media queries before? Really, what's a media query? Did I even sign up for this course? [^5]   

## 6. All of your certificates are now even cooler

__Reality:__ Whoa, who's this _Accredible_ now? Wait, is it a Gymnasium certificate or _not_? [^6]   

## Okay, so now what?

We will be posting updates more regularly over the next few days as the various lights turn on and off. As a thanks-in-advance for your patience over the next few days, please enjoy this little glimpse behind the scenes from earlier today.

[^1]: Sorry, but the downtime is pretty much unavoidable. Even if our migration process ran faster, there are other things that get in the way... like the time it takes for new [DNS records to propagate](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/05/introduction-to-dns-explaining-the-dreaded-dns-delay/). I know, not an excuse... 

[^2]: Seriously - you have no idea how much happens behind the scenes to get you this email, with the exact courses you took, and the last lesson you viewed, and your certificates. Trust me, it's quite amazing.

[^3]: We can. _Really_. Just not right now. We did have LinkedIn authentication up and running... until they made a minor change to their API that broke major things. To maintain our sanity, we decided to put it on the road map as an upcoming feature.

[^4]: Yeah, so I can't blame LinkedIn for this one. During a round of QA testing, we discovered that the un-enroll function wasn't working. At all. It's on the road map. You'll love it.

[^5]: This is more of that amazing-what-happens-behind-the-scenes stuff. We can't get you to the last minute and second of video you were watching... but we should be able to get you back the last video (or quiz). Some data won't get migrated at all... like the old forum posts. So if you want be mad about _something_, the forum posts thing is an easy choice. 

[^6]: Yes, it's a Gymnasium certificate. [This post](http://gymnasium.github.io/2015/08/05/certificates/) has more detail about certificates.
