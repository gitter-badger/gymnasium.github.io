title: Let's Talk About Certification...

Did you know that the earliest diplomas were hand written on sheepskin? This was at a time before the first printing presses, and also during a notable paper shortage. For the record, Gymnasium certificates have always been made from only the very finest quality PostScript code. While they are _technically_ a far cry from those original diplomas, we know that they are just as meaningful. And, considering how few people finish online courses, they are also quite rare.

Certfication will continue to be an important part of the Gymnasium experience, and we intend to make those certificates even more useful to you! To this end, we've joined forces with the folks at [Accredible](http://accredible.com). They've come up with a brilliant service for hosting digital credentials, and we think that you're going to love it!

__In a nutshell:__

- Your Gymnasium certificates will be hosted by Accredible - a lot like photos at Flickr
- You decide which certificates (and with whom) to share
- You can still download and share the PDF like before
- You can upload your assignments, sketches, screen shots -- providing further evidence of the work you did in the course
- We'll convert all prior Gymnasium certificates as part of the data migration, so they'll be there waiting for you

And last, but definitely not least:

__You will _finally_ be able to share your achievement on your LinkedIn profile!!!__
