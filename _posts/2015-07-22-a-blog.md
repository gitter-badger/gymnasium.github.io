__tl;dr. We should have done this in the very beginning.__

This month marks our second year of operation. Pretty cool, huh?

In these past two years, over 50,000 of you have taken classes with us. We've streamed millions of hours of video to you, and we've issued thousands of certificates to those of you who have completed and passed those courses. You've learned a lot, and _we_ have certainly learned a lot as well.

We had talked about a publishing a blog -- apparently for two years -- but never really did it. Instead, we sent you emails. At least we can't be blamed for having been _overly_ communicative.

We're now on the brink of some really exciting stuff, and we're going to let you know about all of it. ALL of it.
